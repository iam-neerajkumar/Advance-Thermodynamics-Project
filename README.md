# 🔥 Advance Thermodynamics Project

## 🎯 Objective

Simulate the thermal dissociation of pure CO₂ and determine the mole fractions of CO₂, CO, and O₂ at different:

- **Temperatures:** 1500 K, 2000 K, 2500 K, 3000 K, 3500 K  
- **Pressures:** 0.1 atm, 1 atm, 10 atm, 100 atm

---

## ⚙️ Method

- Used the **Newton-Raphson method** to solve a nonlinear equation related to chemical equilibrium.
- Calculated the mole fractions of each gas for various temperature and pressure conditions.
